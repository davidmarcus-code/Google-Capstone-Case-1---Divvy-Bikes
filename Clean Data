### 1. Description

```{load packages}
Some have been used for testing purposes, so most libraries are here for referencial reasons.
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(rmdformats)
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)
```

### 2. Import the Data
Taking each file and reading them by month.

Feb_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/1.Feb2nd2022.csv")
Mar_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/2.Mar2nd2022.csv")
Apr_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/3.Apr6th2022.csv")
May_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/4.May3rd2022.csv")
Jun_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/5.Jun4th2022.csv")
Jul_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/6.Jul15th2022.csv")
Aug_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/7.Aug5th2022.csv")
Sep_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/8.Sep8th2022.csv")
Oct_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/9.Oct11th2022.csv")
Nov_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/10.Nov8th2022.csv")
Dec_22 <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/11.Dec5th2022.csv")
Jan_23 <-read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/12 months of Data - Copy/12.Jan3rd2023.csv")

### 3. Check the data structure
Skimming each file to make sure each file is consistent in its varibale types. Each data set puts out 9 character columns and 4 numeric. Also helps to check which columns 
contain empty values. 

skim(Feb_22)
skim(Mar_22)
skim(Apr_22)
skim(May_22)
skim(Jun_22)
skim(Jul_22)
skim(Aug_22)
skim(Sep_22)
skim(Oct_22)
skim(Nov_22)
skim(Dec_22)
skim(Jan_23)

### 4. Merge the data
Merging all 12 months into a year.

yearly_trips <- rbind(Feb_22,Mar_22,Apr_22,May_22,Jun_22,Jul_22,Aug_22,Sep_22,Oct_22,Nov_22,Dec_22,Jan_23)

### 5. Make the dates from chr to dates
Converting the times from characters into dates for finding the difference. Dates are Year-month-day hour-minute-second

yearly_trips$started_at <- as.POSIXct(yearly_trips$started_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
yearly_trips$ended_at <- as.POSIXct(yearly_trips$ended_at, format =  "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

### 6. Filter and remove null rows
Filtering out rows that contain empty columns.

filter(yearly_trips, !is.na(start_station_name) | start_station_name != "")
filter(yearly_trips, !is.na(end_station_name) | end_station_name != "")
filter(yearly_trips, !is.na(start_station_id) | start_station_id != "")
filter(yearly_trips, !is.na(end_station_id) | end_station_id != "")

### 7. Find the difference - ride_length
Taking the difference in time, converting the seconds into numeric, then checking and removing any ride lengths that are negative.

yearly_trips$ride_length <- difftime(yearly_trips$ended_at, yearly_trips$started_at)

is.factor(yearly_trips$ride_length)

yearly_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(yearly_trips$ride_length))

is.numeric(yearly_trips$ride_length)


### 8. Weekday
We want to find what day the user started and assign that day the apporpriate number value. Sun = 1 and Sat = 7

yearly_trips$day_of_week <- as.POSIXct(yearly_trips$started_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
yearly_trips$weekday <- weekdays(yearly_trips$day_of_week)
yearly_trips$day_of_week <- wday(yearly_trips$day_of_week)


trips_cleaned <- yearly_trips %>%
  filter(!(ride_length < 0))

tibble(yearly_trips$ride_length)

### 9. Save file
Save the data file
 
write.csv(trips_cleaned, "C:\\Users\\david\\Desktop\\12 months of Data\\trips_cleaned.csv", row.names=FALSE)
