### 1. Library
library(tidyverse)

### 2. Basic Information
Import the data and look at the mean, median, max and min 

trips <- read.csv("C:/Users/david/Desktop/12 months of Data/trips_cleaned.csv")

mean(trips$ride_length) #straight average (total ride length / rides) = 1166.875
median(trips$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths = 617
max(trips$ride_length) #longest ride = 2486835
min(trips$ride_length) #shortest ride = 0

### 3. Aggregate Data
# See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
trips$weekday <- ordered(trips$weekday, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

aggregate(trips$ride_length ~ trips$member_casual + trips$weekday, FUN = mean)

### 4. Visualize Data
trips %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)

# Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type
trips %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
	
trips %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

### 5. Export Data
counts <- aggregate(trips$ride_length ~ trips$member_casual + trips$weekday, FUN = mean)

write.csv(counts, file = 'C:\\Users\\david\\Desktop\\12 months of Data\\avg_ride_length.csv')
